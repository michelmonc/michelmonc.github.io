            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As a Cuban immigrant who has traveled to four different countries, I have a unique perspective and a diverse set of experiences that have shaped my journey thus far. I am currently studying computer science and pursuing a career in cybersecurity engineering.

My passion for cybersecurity stems from a desire to help people and organizations protect themselves against evolving digital threats. To further my knowledge in the field, I am actively pursuing various cybersecurity certificates while completing my college studies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through internships and work projects. I have worked on several security-related projects, including penetration testing and network security assessments, and have developed strong problem-solving and analytical skills as a result.

Overall, my dedication to my education and professional development, combined with my unique background and experiences, make me an ideal candidate for a career in cybersecurity engineering. I am excited to contribute to the industry and help make the digital world a safer place for everyone.

                <p>This is a video about how to use the merge sort method. The video has two points showing the merge sort method and showing that 
                  AI can be fun to use and does not have to be scary.
                  Especially now with the evolution of Chat GPT, many people are scared about the future of AI with this video we use AI for the voices, effects, and audio, making it more fun and interactive.</p>

                <h3>Timed Hand Washing Water Dispenser</h3>
                <p>The recommended amount of time to wash your hands is at least 20 seconds. Not only is it a good practice, but it can also reduce the spread of covid. We have noticed that most of the time, especially when we are in a hurry, we might wash our hands for a few seconds and move on about our day. 
                  There are some sinks that have automated valves that use sensors which helps to reduce contact. However, some of them do not dispense water for 20 seconds and there is no way of ensuring that you are washing your hands for 20 seconds. You would have to use your phone or something else as a timer. 
                  Our product aims to solve this issue by using a sensor to dispense water while displaying a timer of how much time has passed.
                   Visually seeing the countdown will also serve as an incentive to actually wash hands for the full 20 seconds.</p>
